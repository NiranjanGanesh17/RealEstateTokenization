#Real Estate Tokenization on Ethereum : 
This project enables the tokenization of real estate assets on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing properties to be represented as digital tokens. These tokens can be used to manage fractional ownership and rental agreements.

Key Features
Fractional Ownership: Each real estate property is represented by a smart contract that issues ERC-20 tokens. These tokens represent shares in the property, allowing multiple investors to own a fraction of the property.

Share Purchases: Investors can buy tokens to acquire shares of the property, enabling fractional ownership and investment in high-value real estate assets.

Rental Agreements: The system includes functionality to manage and track rental agreements. Token holders can lease their shares, earning rental income proportional to their ownership.

Smart Contracts: All transactions, including share purchases and rental agreements, are managed through Ethereum smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security.
